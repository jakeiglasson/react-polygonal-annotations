## make sure it works with any size image

<!-- prevent user-select (double clicking highlight) on
div container with class polygonalAnnotationImageContainer
all child and child of child elements of div with class polygonalAnnotationImageContainer -->

- implement options.editable
- add logic to center text in generated rectangle
  add logic so rectangle expands to fit text width, original code has a max width, so rectangle will need have a max width but unlimited height
